# Fake Call Android App

**Fake Call Android App** is a feature-rich Android application that provides users with a customizable fake calling experience. This app allows users to schedule and customize fake calls, including the caller's name, image, and contact information retrieved from the phone. The app is designed with **service** and **broadcast receivers** to function seamlessly, even when the app is not in the foreground. Additionally, it includes settings, navigation drawer, and bottom navigation for smooth navigation, along with ad integration for monetization.
